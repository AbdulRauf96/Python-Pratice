# I generally right in a Jupyter notebook, but I have been working around to using PyCharm.
# With PyCharm we can import projects to a desktop and upload projects to github aswell.
# The only thing with PyCharm is that it is paid except for a student version so we have a limited time to use it.
# While google colab is a better alterative to saving specific notebooks to a project.
